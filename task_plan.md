# Task Plan: Align Braille App UI With thehub Design Reference
<!-- 
  WHAT: This is your roadmap for the entire task. Think of it as your "working memory on disk."
  WHY: After 50+ tool calls, your original goals can get forgotten. This file keeps them fresh.
  WHEN: Create this FIRST, before starting any work. Update after each phase completes.
-->

## Goal
Update the braille app UI to match the design language in `thehub-designreference` (tiles, colors, background, overall look) while excluding the sidebar.

## Current Phase
Phase 3

## Phases

### Phase 1: Requirements & Discovery
- [x] Understand user intent
- [x] Identify constraints and requirements

- [x] Document findings in findings.md
- **Status:** complete

### Phase 2: Planning & Structure
- [x] Define UI changes and mapping from reference to app components
- [x] Identify files/components/styles to update
- [x] Document decisions with rationale
- **Status:** complete

### Phase 3: Implementation
- [x] Update styles/components to match reference design language
- [ ] Ensure responsiveness and usability
- [x] Keep sidebar excluded
- **Status:** in_progress

### Phase 4: Testing & Verification
- [ ] Verify updated UI matches reference (tiles, colors, background)
- [ ] Check desktop and mobile rendering
- [ ] Document test results in progress.md
- **Status:** pending

### Phase 5: Delivery
- [ ] Review modified files
- [ ] Summarize changes for user
- [ ] Provide next steps if needed
- **Status:** pending

## Key Questions
1. Which files define the current braille app UI layout and styling?
2. What specific colors/spacing/typography/tiles are shown in the reference files?
3. Are there any constraints in the existing design system we must preserve?

## Decisions Made
| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
|          |           |

## Errors Encountered
| Error | Attempt | Resolution |

| session-catchup script failed (CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT empty) | 1 | Proceeded by using known template path under /home/jacob/.codex/skills/planning-with-files |

## Notes
- Update phase status as you progress: pending → in_progress → complete
- Re-read this plan before major decisions (attention manipulation)
- Log ALL errors - they help avoid repetition
